## What is this tutorial?

This is the second step in a series of tutorials which explain how to use Scala.js in an [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) sbt project.

In this step, we will use Li Haoyi's [ScalaTags](http://www.lihaoyi.com/scalatags) library to create a dynamic, reactive webpage using only Scala code.

Open [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md) for the step-by-step tutorial.
